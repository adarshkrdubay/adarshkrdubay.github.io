        Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) was a zero-day vulnerability in Log4j, a popular Java logging framework, involving arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability has existed unnoticed since 2013 and was privately disclosed to the Apache Software Foundation, of which Log4j is a project, by Chen Zhaojun of Alibaba Cloud's security team on 24 November 2021, and was publicly disclosed on 9 December 2021. Apache gave Log4Shell a CVSS severity rating of 10, the highest available score. The exploit is simple to execute and is estimated to affect hundreds of millions of devices.

        The vulnerability takes advantage of Log4j's allowing requests to arbitrary LDAP and JNDI servers, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary Java code on a server or other computer, or leak sensitive information. A list of its affected software projects has been published by the Apache Security Team. Affected commercial services include Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare, iCloud, Minecraft: Java Edition, Steam, Tencent QQ and many others. According to Wiz and EY, the vulnerability affected 93% of enterprise cloud environments.
        
        Experts described Log4Shell as the largest vulnerability ever; LunaSec characterized it as "a design failure of catastrophic proportions", Tenable said the exploit was "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability ever",Ars Technica called it "arguably the most severe vulnerability ever" and The Washington Post said that descriptions by security professionals "border on the apocalyptic".
