OSINT stands for “open source intelligence.” It’s all about finding information you can legally access, through legal means. OSINT is mainly done online, but it can be done offline as well. Pentesters use OSINT to research their targets, and threat intelligence specialists use OSINT to learn about cyber threats. OSINT is an important tool for both the red team and the blue team.<a href="OSINT.html" >Read more</a>

So the last option was just hack someone’s WIFI , But......<a href="How_I_hacked_my_1st_wifi_p2">Read Full.</a>
